Welcome to the final project of Software Development 1
This project does all of the following: allows the creation of a search tree, allows the additon of nodes,
allows you to find weather or not an element exist, finds the high of the tree, finds largest and smallest interger,
find the nth largest element, Delete and reorganizes i post, in, and preorder
has a Depth First Search option
HOW TO USE:
The binary tree is already created as end (to symbolize the end of the year).  If you want to change that it is in the Main method
To add elements do end.add(); this will add a value to the binary search tree.
To see if a node exists inside of the Search tree use the end.find() command in order to check the program for a number
To find the height of the tree use the end.height(root) command
To find the min value of the tree use the end.minvalue(root) command
To find the max value it quite similar use the end.maxvalue(root) command
To find the nth largest value use the nthlargest(root,(n number)
To delete a node use the following command end.deleteNode(end.root,(Number))
To show the search tree in an inorder format use the end.inordertraversal(end.root) command
To show the search tree in an preorder format use the end.Preorder(); command
To show the search tree in an postorder format use the end.Postorder(); command
To search the tree via a breath format use the end.Breathsetup();
To search the tree via a Depth first search use end.Depth;
