    "After obtaing the variables for one order it went through a loop 15 times till all the orders of the customers have been taken.  While this is happening the program is multiplaying the quantity of the items by their price and adding up the tips.  At the end it displays all of the values which are equivalent if you don't mess up the inputs.  On completion is will show the exact same numbers as the wet code.  This is better way to do it as it runs through a loop and requires less hard code and allows the customers to order themseleves. \r\n",
